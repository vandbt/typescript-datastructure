# Typescript datastructure

This is Typescript Data Structure project, but It's not aim to Fast, Light, and Powerful implementation.

## Motivation
This project aims to show how Typescript (Typed Language) solves well-known software problem. That's why This project implements data structures.

This project want shows OOP(Object-Oritend-Programming) with Typescript.

This project want shows modern develoment methodology TDD(Test-Driven Development), BDD(Behvior-Driven Development).

This project want shows How to manage software health continuosly.

Build / Test Automation ( with Code coverage Report) would shows current status of software health.
 

### Installing

```
npm run setup
```

### Running the tests

```
npm test
```

test reports only.

```
npm run test-with-coverage
```
will generates coverage reports with test reports.


### And coding style tests

Writes Test specs according by [Specification by Example](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/specification-example) that would be [Living Documentation](https://leanpub.com/livingdocumentation).

```
Given
When
Then
```
as possible.


## Code documentation
[Typedoc](http://typedoc.org/) would generates code documents from code comments.

```
npm run docs
```


## Deployment

This project setup deployments automatically. [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Github release](https://github.com/vandbt/typescript-datastructure/releases).
